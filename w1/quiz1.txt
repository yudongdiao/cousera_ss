1. Three classic security properties:
	-Confidentiality
	-Integrity
	-Availability

2. Why is it that the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable?
	-As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on who called the function

3. How does a buffer overflow on the stack facilitate running attacker-injected code?
	-By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code.

4. An integer overflow occurs when an integer is used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds.
